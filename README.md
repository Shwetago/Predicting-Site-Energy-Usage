# Predicting-Site-Energy-Usage

ðŸ§¾**Description:** According to aÂ reportÂ issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to 
demolition was responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically 
reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies. 

The dataset consists of building characteristics, weather data for the location of the building, as well as the energy usage for the 
building, and the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site EUI). Each row in the data corresponds to a single building 
observed in a given year.

ðŸ§­**Problem Statement:** You are provided with two datasets: 
(1) the train_dataset where the observed values of the Site EUI for each row are provided. 
(2) In the x_test dataset the observed values of the Site EUI for each row are removed and provided separately in y_test. 
Your task is to predict the Site EUI for each row (using the complete training dataset), given the characteristics of the building and the 
weather data for the location of the building. Use the test sets for validation and testing. 

**Understanding features:**

year_Factor: anonymized year in which the weather and energy usage factors were observed

state_Factor: anonymized state in which the building is located

building_class: building classification

facility_type: building usage type

floor_area: floor area (in square feet) of the building

year_built: year in which the building was constructed

energy_star_rating: the energy star rating of the building

elevation: elevation of the building location

january_min_temp: minimum temperature in January (in Fahrenheit) at the location of the building

january_avg_temp: average temperature in January (in Fahrenheit) at the location of the building

january_max_temp: maximum temperature in January (in Fahrenheit) at the location of the building

[Similarly for all other months]

cooling_degree_days: cooling degree day for a given day is the number of degrees where the daily average temperature
exceeds 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each month is summed to produce an annual total at the location of the building.

heating_degree_days: heating degree day for a given day is the number of degrees where the daily average temperature falls under 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Each month is summed to produce an annual total at the location of the building.

precipitation_inches: annual precipitation in inches at the location of the building

snowfall_inches: annual snowfall in inches at the location of the building

snowdepth_inches: annual snow depth in inches at the location of the building

avg_temp: average temperature over a year at the location of the building

days_below_30F: total number of days below 30 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

days_below_20F: total number of days below 20 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

days_below_10F: total number of days below 10 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

days_below_0F: total number of days below 0 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

days_above_80F: total number of days above 80 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

days_above_90F: total number of days above 90 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

days_above_100F: total number of days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

days_above_110F: total number of days above 110 degrees Fahrenheit at the location of the building

direction_max_wind_speed: wind direction for maximum wind speed at the location of the building. Given in 360-degree compass point 
directions (e.g. 360 = north, 180 = south, etc.).

direction_peak_wind_speed: wind direction for peak wind gust speed at the location of the building. Given in 360-degree compass point 
directions (e.g. 360 = north, 180 = south, etc.).

max_wind_speed: maximum wind speed at the location of the building

days_with_fog: number of days with fog at the location of the building

building_id: building id
